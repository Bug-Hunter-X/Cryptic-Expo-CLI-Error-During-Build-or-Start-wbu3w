# Cryptic Expo CLI Error During Build or Start

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: cryptic error messages during the build or start process.  The error messages themselves are often unhelpful, making debugging difficult.  This example showcases a potential scenario and provides a solution.

## Problem

The core issue is the lack of specific error messages from the Expo CLI.  It might show a generic failure, or the build might simply fail without clear indication of the root cause.  This can be due to several reasons, including dependency conflicts, incorrect configurations within the `app.json` or `package.json`, or issues with native modules.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully checking the following:

1. **Package.json:** Verify that all dependencies are compatible and correctly listed.  Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to check the dependency tree for conflicts.
2. **App.json:** Review the configuration settings for any potential errors or inconsistencies.
3. **Native Modules:**  If using native modules, ensure they are correctly linked and configured for your environment.
4. **Expo CLI Version:** Update to the latest version of the Expo CLI using `expo upgrade`.
5. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
6. **Check logs:**  Look for detailed error logs in the terminal; sometimes the main error message is accompanied by a more detailed one further down.
7. **Reproduce the error:** Try to isolate the conditions under which the error occurs to better debug it.  Simplify your app or try to create a minimal reproducible example.

This repository provides example code to illustrate the problem and solution. The `expoBug.js` file might contain code that triggers the error (this example demonstrates it conceptually), and `expoBugSolution.js` suggests ways to fix it.

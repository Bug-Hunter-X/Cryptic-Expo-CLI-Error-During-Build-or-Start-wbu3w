The solution to this kind of error is not one-size-fits-all.  The `expoBugSolution.js` file doesn't contain a single fix, but rather outlines a troubleshooting strategy. It's about carefully examining the following:

1. **Check `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible. Run `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze the dependency tree and look for conflicts or outdated packages.
```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js -  Focus on dependency management
npm ls //Check dependencies
npm update // Update packages
npm install --force // force reinstall
```
2. **Review `app.json`:** Verify all settings are correct, especially if you recently changed anything related to build configurations or assets.
3. **Clean the cache:** Deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling packages is a standard troubleshooting step.  Also, delete the `.expo` directory.
4. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure you're using the latest version: `expo upgrade`.
5. **Console Logs:** Check the complete logs in the terminal. Often, deeper errors are hidden behind the initial message.
6. **Minimal Reproducible Example:** Create a very simple Expo project that reproduces the error to help identify the source of the problem.
